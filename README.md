# Linq Assignment

## Overview

I asked for an internship and this is what they gave me instead. But it is ok. Happy to learn and create.
To create mock data and store it in my data storage solution of choice. MongoDB, I choose you!
Then to visualize the data, using matplotlib. All containerized for extra credits.

Also if you are on windows, the entrypoint.sh file may be invisible, if you are using VSCODE, 
go to the lower right corner of the window and change CRLF to LF, should work without worries

## To Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build
